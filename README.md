## Installation
Initialize a new local repo, clone the repository for this project, and install node.js. The app may be run from the command line using "node app" when the user is in the local repo directory.

Answer the questions, and when prompted, specify whether or not to add another employee. If No is selected, a new HTML file will be generated in the "dist" folder of the project. Open the html file in a browser to view the generated team.
